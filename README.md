# p5js_workshop
“Learning to code by drawing”
<p>Workshop duration: 3.5 hours including a 30-minute break</p>

I was assigned by UTech Lab to deliver a workshop on creative coding to students ages 10-18 as an introductory course to programming. I used p5.js to design a simple but challenging in terms of algorithmic thinking “sketch” and created step-by-step educational hand-outs.

The workshop materials that you should be downloading are the two zipped folders. The one called <b>"instructor"</b> contains the instructor's notes and some images to be used during the delivery of the workshop.

The <b>"ENG_p5js_workshop"</b> includes all the course materials that should be downloaded to the students' computers so that they can work on them. The students should be writing their code inside the "sketch.js" file. I have also included a cheat file with detailed descriptions of every step. You can find this file inside the sub-folder "libraries," under the name "theory_cheatsheet.js."

Although I delivered the workshop in Greek, I have now translated all the materials in English for everyone to use.

I consider p5 as an excellent tool to get more kids into programming and the workshops that I delivered were a great success.

Enjoy and I hope you find this useful!
