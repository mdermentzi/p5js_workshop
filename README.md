# p5js_workshop
““Learning to code by drawing” I was assigned by UTech Lab to deliver a coding workshop on creative programming to students ages 10-18. I used p5.js to design a simple but challenging, in terms of algorithmic thinking, “sketch” and created step-by-step educational hand-outs.

This project consists of two folders. The one called "instructor" contains the instructor's notes and some images to be used during the delivery of the workshop.

The "ENG_p5js_workshop" includes all the course materials that should be downloaded to the students' computers so that they can work on them. The students should be writing their code inside the "sketch.js" file. I have also included a cheat file with detailed descriptions on every step. You can find this file inside the sub-folder "libraries," under the name "theory_cheatsheet.js."

Enjoy!
